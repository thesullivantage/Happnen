+ You can also find larger events like concerts, trivia events, happy hours, parties, and marriage receptions.


+ When you first open the page, You will see a map including all of the public events happening near you.
+ Once on the home page, You have the option to redirect over to the login page or the sign up page.

+ Once a user has logged in or created an account, they will be redirected back to the map page.  
+ Once an account is created the user will have the ability to create their own events that will populate on the map page.
+ The user will be able to create public, private, and invite only events.


+ Another feature the user can access once an account is created is their own personal profile page.
