        * To actually log in (with the current bug), go to the lower right hand button
        and click on the map button after logging in or 
        creating an account
#### * View Map (Public Events)
        * Modals with event details can be accessed via side menu or by clicking on the pins themselves
        * Private/Invite Only events not displayed on the map
                * Invite Only events development in progress
#### * Create an Event
        * Encrypted

#### - Neverending Callbacks (Refactoring in Progress)
#### - Asynchronicity issue with storing basic session storage parameter (placeholder login functionality)
#### - Cannot click on same map pin twice sequentially
