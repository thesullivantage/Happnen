# My Thought Process on Workflow

## Front-End/Back-End Task Separation (For Now)
- Allows front-end team to get the basic react funtionality going
  * Continuously incorporate backend stuff, backend team can help with this
- Back-end team can work from blanket html (created as the front-end squad's first task) on functionality, and then it can be incorporated into react

## Trello
### *PLEASE USE!!!*
- **Keeps us all on the same page, and hopefully avoiding the creation of _unnecessary_ functionality/pages**

### Deadlines Feature
- Convenient because â†’ it allows us to check off the deadline as complete and trello lets you then sort cards that have the:
  * Deadline Marked as complete </br>
  _OR_
  * Deadline NOT marked as complete
- To boot: __*It keeps us on track*__
